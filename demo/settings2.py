#### You must configure the following item

user_collection('1366641', api_key = 'X4iUU2a7P5mQWNTO7hvuQwzB', collection='FCQK6PT6', top_level=True)

# '1366641' #  user ID (e.g., six numeric digits)
# 'X4iUU2a7P5mQWNTO7hvuQwzB'  # api_key: not-so-secret key (from Zotero Feeds/API settings)
# 'FCQK6PT6'  # collection where to find the bibliographic items.
# true # toplevel - include the top level as well as a collection
# (You can load a group collection with group_collection().)


#### Optional configuration

sort_criteria = ['type','-date']   # we have date and type: First by date ("issued"), then by type.

# The sort_criteria determine the structure of the bibliography.
# Allowable values: 'type' (category of publication, e.g., journal article),
# 'date' (full date)
# 'year' (year of publication)
# 'collection' (the subcollection the article is placed in).
# Collection works best at the beginning of the list.
# add - in front of the field name to sort in descending order (e.g., -date will show the newest entries first).

# See also: show_top_section_headings setting below.

# Two typical variants are shown:
# Thematic, by collection
#sort_criteria = ['collection','-date']   # First by collection, then type, then by date, latest first.
# By type (journal, conference, etc.), then chronologically
# sort_criteria = ['type','-date']   # we have date and type: First by date ("issued"), then by type.
# By year, then with journal articles first
# sort_criteria = ['-year']   # we have date and type: First by date ("issued"), then by type.
# By date only, newest first
#sort_criteria = ['-date']   # we have date and type: First by date ("issued"), then by type.
