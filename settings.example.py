## You must configure the authentication settings and one collection key.

#### AUTHENTICATION ############################################################

# Group/User:  You may either display a library for a Zotero user,
# or for a group.

# User:
# You may find your user ID for the library_id setting under
# "Settings -> Feeds/API":
#    https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys
# library_type is 'user'.

# Group:
# Find your library_id by selecting the group on the Zotero website,
# and then choose "Group Settings".  The URL in your browser
# window will then show you a six-digit number,
# e.g.,  .../groups/110233/settings
# library_type is 'group'.

library_id = '160464' # your group or user ID (e.g., six numeric digits)
library_type ='group'  # 'group' or 'user'

# Data from private Zotero accounts:

# If you want to retrieve non-public data from Zotero, youâ€™ll need a
# Zotero account (or group) at zotero.org.  Log into your account,
# access the Settings page on the Zotero site and create an private
# API key (under "Settings -> Feeds/API").  For the key, check "Allow
# library access".  This key is used in the api_key setting.

api_key = None  # secret key (from Zotero)

#### COLLECTIONS TO BE RENDERED ################################################

# In your library, you may create a collection, for example, "website".
# Within it, create titled sub-collections, like so:

# toRead
# thesis
# website
#    *10 Selected Works
#    20 Journal Articles
#    30 Conference Proceedings
#    40 Theses

# Now, find the IDs of the top-level collection called "website".
# When you click on it on the Zotero website, your browser will show you an alphanumeric
# key in the URL, e.g., items/collectionKey/FCQM2AY6.  The portion 'FCQM2AY6' is what you
# would use in toplevelfilter.

# To display the whole library with all its collections,
# leave toplevelfilter set to None.  You may use that to see a list of all collections
# when zot_bib_web runs.

# ID string of the top-collection that is going to be ignored (as a level), or None
# If set, we will display the items available underneath this collection.
# otherwise, all collections available will be displayed.
toplevelfilter = None # e.g., 'MGID93AS'

additional_collections = []  # additional collections to be added from outside of the toplevelfilter

#### SPECIAL OPTIONS: STYLE ####################################################
# Special settings - configure only if needed.

# The sort_criteria determine the structure of the bibliography.
# Allowable values: 'type' (category of publication, e.g., journal article),
# 'date' (full date)
# 'year' (year of publication)
# 'collection' (the subcollection the article is placed in).
# Collection works best at the beginning of the list.
# add - in front of the field name to sort in descending order (e.g., -date will show the newest entries first).

# sort_criteria = ['collection','-date']   # First by collection, then type, then by date, latest first.
sort_criteria = ['type','-date']   # we have date and type: First by date ("issued"), then by type.
#sort_criteria = ['-year','type']   # Ordered by year.

# show section headings for the primary search criterion

# Limit - for fast testing and debugging

# You may also give the --limit argument to zot.py
limit=None
